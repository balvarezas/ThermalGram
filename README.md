Event: FLIR's "Bring the Heat" Hacker and Maker Challenge

DevPost: http://devpost.com/software/thermalgram

An Android application that utilizes the FLIR One camera to produce and share thermal selfies with family, friends, and social media. In addition, users can rate their own and other people's "thelfies" "hotness" on a scale from 1 to 5. Developed for the FLIR "Bring the Heat" Hacker and Maker Challenge San Francisco event. 

Using the FLIR One, we captured thelfies (thermal images) from the Android client and uploaded them to a web server, where the images were processed on a temperature scale and then rendered on a mobile-friendly web page where users could subjectively rate the thermal images. Users can also share their thelfie images with social media and other applications using the built-in Share option in the Android app.
